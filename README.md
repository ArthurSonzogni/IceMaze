# Description
~~~
IceMaze is puzzle game.

You play a block moving on the ice. Each time you move, you are forced to slide
until a wall stops you. Reaching the finish position will not be easy.

About twenty levels and various blocks (locks, corner, wormhole,…)

Create your own levels with the level editor, or use the level generator.
~~~

This game use the [SMK library](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/smk) made by
the same author of this game.

Disclaimer:
~~~
This game was originaly made 11 years ago in 2009. It was my very
first C++ game. Then I converted it to WebAssembly. Even if it has been hugely
refactored this year, its code is still a bit "low quality".
